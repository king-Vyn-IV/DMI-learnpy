Overview
This documentation outlines the key components and steps to learn and apply Python programming, focusing on essential concepts, libraries, and frameworks such as Django for web development. It also provides a roadmap for setting up the environment and starting projects.
Topics to be learned on the website
•	Core Python Concepts: Variables, Data Types, Control Structures, Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries
•	Data Analysis Libraries: Numpy, Pandas
•	Visualization Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn
•	Advanced Topics: Statistics and Probability, Machine Learning
•	Web Development: Development of Django Applications
Setup and Environment Configuration
Step 1.1: Install Python and Django
1.	Install the latest stable version of Python.
o	Visit the official Python website python.org and download the installer.
2.	Install Django using pip:

Step 1.2: Create a Virtual Environment
Isolate project dependencies using `venv`:
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # For Linux/MacOS
env\Scripts\activate     # For Windows

Use the virtual environment for all project installations.

Start a Django Project
Step 2.1: Create a New Project
Use the Django command-line utility to start a project:
django-admin startproject project_name
Step 2.2: Run the Development Server
Verify that the setup works by starting the server:
python manage.py runserver
Access the server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to see the default Django welcome page.
Create a Django App
Step 3.1: Generate an App
Create an app within the project to handle specific functionality:
python manage.py startapp app_name
Step 3.2: Register the App
Add the app to the INSTALLED_APPS list in settings.py:
INSTALLED_APPS = [..., 'app_name',]
Create Views and Templates
Step 6.1: Define Views
Open the views.py file in your app directory.
Define a view function to handle requests. Example:
from django.http import HttpResponse
def index(request): return HttpResponse('Hello, World!')
Step 6.2: Create Templates
Create a templates directory in your app folder.
Add HTML files for your pages and use the Django template syntax for dynamic content.
